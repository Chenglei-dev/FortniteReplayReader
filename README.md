# FortniteReplayReader
Reading player eliminations, how many players you eliminated, your position and total player count from Fortnite replay files.

This is the code created on a live stream at https://www.twitch.tv/fredimachadotv
The video is available on YouTube at https://youtu.be/m2Twu9k5VQQ

## How to run
- Download and install .NET Core 2.1 SDK at https://www.microsoft.com/net/download
- Open a Powershell/CMD/Terminal, CD to the code and run: dotnet run

I really recommend you to download and install Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio IDE Community though (They are free!)
They are available at https://visualstudio.microsoft.com
